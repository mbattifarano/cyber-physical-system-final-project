\section{Introduction}

The traffic network equilibrium problem, also known as the traffic assignment problem, aims to identify traffic pattern on transportation network which arises after a set of travellers determine the least cost path through the network between their origin and destination.\citep{nagurney2009netecon}
The travel cost along each link in the network is a function of the traffic volume on the link, so each traveller must take into account the actions of other travellers when determining their own least cost route.

Solving the traffic assignment problem is a critical to transportation planning because it can compute roadway usage given travel demand and some mild assumptions on traveller behavior.
Often, planning applications take the form of a transportation network design problem (NDP) in which design parameters are optimized with traffic equilibrium as a constraint.
For example, \citet{sheffi1983optimal} find the signal timings that minimize travel delay subject to the constraint that traffic is at equilibrium.

This project will frame the network design problem as a Differential Hybrid Game \citep{DBLP:journals/tocl/Platzer17} in order to verify properties of the network at equilibrium without explicitly computing the equilibrium traffic flow.
% Additionally, the project will draw connections between the Differential Hybrid Game formulation and the Traffic Network verification presented in \citet{DBLP:conf/itsc/MullerMP15}.
