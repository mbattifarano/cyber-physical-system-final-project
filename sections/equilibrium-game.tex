\section{Traffic User Equilibrium as a Differential Game}

In this section we lay the groundwork for reasoning about traffic equilibrium. 
We can rephrase \eqref{eqn:ui-vi} in first order logic in \eqref{eqn:ui-vi:fol}.
For brevity let $\Omega = \Omega_d \cap \Omega_s$ denote the feasible set of traffic flows.

\begin{align}
    \exists \mathbf{y}\in \Omega \forall \mathbf{z}\in \Omega (\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{y})(\mathbf{z}- \mathbf{y}) &\geq 0) \label{eqn:ui-vi:fol}
\end{align}

If we can express $\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{y})(\mathbf{z}- \mathbf{y})$ as the prime of some term $F$ in the context of some differential $x'=f(x,\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$ then we leverage the differential game invariant proof rule (DGI) introduced in \citet{DBLP:journals/tocl/Platzer17}.
Here we present a special case of DGI.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\exists y\in Y \forall z\in Z [x'\assigned f(x,y,z)](F' \geq 0)$}
    \LeftLabel{DGI}
    \UnaryInfC{$F\geq 0 \implies [x'=f(x,y,z) \& y \in Y^d \& z\in Z] (F\geq 0)$}
\end{prooftree}

In this setting,

% In what sense to y and z influence each other? or some shared state x?
% Could we rephrase as a projection onto \Omega?
% what is the existence condition for equilibrium?
% What do x and x' represent?
% What does F represent?
