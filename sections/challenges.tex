\section{Expected challenges}

I anticipate the single biggest challenge of this project being the formulation of network equilibrium problem as a differential hybrid game. In particular, I will have to be careful about the choice of link performance function $\mathbf{t}$ to ensure that it both faithfully models reality while satisfying the assumptions on the form of the differential equations laid out in \citet{DBLP:journals/tocl/Platzer17}. While it is clear how to formulate the strategy of angel the traffic controller provides input to the system, it is less clear how to do the same for demon the traffic fleet. Conceptually, demon ``reacts'' to angels strategy by re-choosing their routes to minimize individual travel time, that is to satisfy \eqref{eqn:ui-vi}. However, specifying this process will be challenging.
